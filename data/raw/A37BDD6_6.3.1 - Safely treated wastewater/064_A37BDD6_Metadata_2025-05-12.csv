SDG Goal,6.3.1 - Safely treated wastewater
Short description,Percentage of domestic wastewater flows that are safely treated.
Definition,"The percentage of domestic wastewater flows that are safely treated, calculated by measuring the volumes of wastewater which are generated through different activities, and the volumes of wastewater which are safely treated before discharge into the environment. Both of these indicators are measured in units of 1000 cubic meters per day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the ‘proportion of wastewater flow safely treated’. Wastewater flows will be classified into industrial, services, and domestic flows, with reference to the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC). To the extent possible, the proportion of each of these waste streams that is safely treated before discharge to the environment will be calculated."

Method of estimation aggregates,"Regional and global aggregates are produced by combining volumes of wastewater generated and treated from countries with data. For the purpose of calculating regional aggregate statistics, values for countries without national estimates are imputed on the basis of regional averages (e.g. using M49 sub-regions). These imputed data are never published separately as national statistics.
Regional and global aggregate statistics are only produced when the data available without imputation represent at least 50% of the regional or global total. Ideally this coverage threshold would be based on wastewater volumes, but data on the volumes of wastewater generated are not available for all countries. Accordingly, as an interim measure, data coverage thresholds and weighting of national statistics will be done on the basis of national population, drawing on the latest statistics available from the UN World Population Prospects."
Rationale,"Wastewater data are crucial to promote strategies for sustainable and safe wastewater use or reuse to the benefit of the world’s population health and the global environment, but also to respond to growing water demands, increasing water pollution loads, and climate change impacts on water resources.
Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) is about ensuring the availability and sustainability of water and sanitation for all by 2030. SDG Target 6.3 sets out to improve ambient water quality, which is essential to protecting both ecosystem and human health, by eliminating, minimizing and significantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies.
The purpose of monitoring progress using SDG indicator 6.3.1 is to provide necessary and timely information to decision makers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to accelerate progress towards reducing water pollution, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and increasing wastewater treatment and reuse. The target wording covers wastewater recycling and safe reuse with implication on water use efficiency, although it is not fully addressed by the global indicator and methodology.
SDG indicator 6.3.1 tracks the proportion of wastewater flows from households, services and industrial economic activities that are safely treated at the source or through centralized wastewater treatment plants before being discharged into the environment, out of the total volume of wastewater generated"
Denominator,"There is a relative lack of knowledge about the volumes of wastewater generated and treated, because wastewater statistics are in an early stage of development in many countries and not regularly produced or reported. Monitoring is relatively complex, costly, and data are not systematically aggregated to the national level and/or accessible; especially industrial wastewater data which are in general poorly monitored and seldom aggregated at national level.
To some extent, this may be explained by the fact that a large proportion of the industrial water requirements are covered by the use of private systems using non-public/drinking water supply (groundwater, rivers and wells) which are not systematically included in the national statistics.
Finally, whether wastewater is classified as safely treated or not depends on the wastewater treatment plant’s compliance rate to the effluent standards (i.e. performance). Many wastewater plants produce effluent which does not meet quality standards, due to improper design or loading. Effluent standards rely on both national and local requirements, as well as on specific water uses and potential reuse options, so that this approach may not provide strictly comparable variables between countries. For the purposes of global monitoring, in the absence of data on compliance, technology-based proxies will be used, in which compliance is assumed if the treatment plant provides at least secondary treatment."
Comments,"Diffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can contribute significantly to wastewater flows, and therefore its progressive inclusion in the global monitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its impact on ambient water quality will be monitored indirectly under indicator 6.3.2 on the proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality.
Different types of wastewater have different degrees of contamination and pose different levels of threat to the environment and public health. Some data exist on the pollutant loading in terms of BOD5 and COD (kg O2/day), but these are not as widely available as data on volumes and will not be used at present for indicator 6.3.1. It is anticipated that future data drives will include more information on pollutant loadings that could be eventually featured in SDG 6.3.1 reporting."
Notes,"The main sources of wastewater include wastewater from households, services and industries, i.e. point sources of one or more pollutant(s) that can be geographically located and represented as a point on a map. Diffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can contribute quite significantly to wastewater flows, and therefore its progressive inclusion in the global monitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its impact on ambient water quality will be monitored under indicator 6.3.2 “Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality”.
Differentiating between the different wastewater streams is important as policy decisions need to be guided by the polluter pays principle. However, wastewater conveyed by combined sewers usually combines both hazardous and non-hazardous substances discharged from different sources, but also runoff and urban stormwater, which cannot be separately tracked and monitored. As a consequence, although the flow of wastewater generated can be disaggregated by sources (domestic, services industrial), the treated wastewater statistics are most commonly disaggregated by type (e.g. urban and industrial) and/or level of treatment (e.g. secondary) rather than by sources."
Data collection process,"A clear specification of the terminology and methodology for wastewater statistics is essential to contribute to harmonising international data collection practices and SDG 6.3.1 reporting. The objective of indicator 6.3.1 is to cover households and the entire economy, and to build on the existing international methodology for global monitoring wastewater generation and treatment. This approach reduces the monitoring burden that SDG reporting can impose on countries, and provides well-defined and internationally comparable variables for global data analysis and use by policymakers and urban/land planners.
Data are extracted from a number of pre-existing sources:
• Indicator tables from the UNSD/UNEP data collection on environment statistics https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators (refer to “Inland Water Resources”)
• Country files from the UNSD/UNEP data collection on environment statistics (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/country_files)
• Website of Eurostat water statistics (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/water) 
• Website of OECD water statistics (https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=water_treat#). 
• Country files from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) data collection on safely managed sanitation services, and the reports referenced therein (https://washdata.org/)
Total flows of wastewater generated and treated are reported by countries to UNSD and OECD/Eurostat databases. Eurostat deals with Member States of the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) as well as the respective candidate countries. OECD works with all its Member States not contacted by Eurostat. UNSD sends the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire to the rest of the world (approx. 165 countries). However, the response rate for the UNSD/UNEP questionnaire is around 50% and data completeness and quality remain a challenge, especially for developing countries. While efforts will continue to collect data from National Statistical Offices and Ministries of Environment at the national level, it is also critical to improve the availability and accessibility of wastewater statistics and increase training for collection of data and capacity development at the national and sub-national levels.
The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) collects and compiles national data related to use of sanitation services including wastewater treatment, for calculation of SDG indicator 6.2.1a “proportion of the population using safely managed sanitation services.” National data sources are collected from National Statistical Offices, ministries responsible for service delivery, and regulatory authorities, as well as other regional and global initiatives (e.g. the European Protocol on Water and Health). The database is updated every two years following a country consultation process facilitated by WHO and UNICEF regional offices.
These databases rely on a comparable harmonized terminology for water statistics. Wastewater data are nonetheless still relatively sparse on a global scale. UN-Habitat and WHO will disseminate information about these data collection processes, and will liaise with their technical focal points in regions and countries, to work with them to produce estimates which could then feed into the official statistical system via the NSOs. It is expected that over time, a better reporting of the wastewater data collected can be made to populate the SDG Indicator 6.3.1."
Preferred data sources,Water and environment statistics
Data providers,"National Statistical Offices (NSOs) are the primary responsible authorities for providing data to be used for global statistics. NSOs may draw on data collected or compiled by relevant national or other authorities, such as ministries, municipalities, or regulatory authorities."
Data compilers,"United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) are co-custodians for this indicator at the global level.
UNSD leads on collecting, compiling, and processing of data submitted by National Statistical Offices through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics for the non-OECD/Eurostat member states.
UN-Habitat leads on collecting, compilation, and processing of data from UNSD and OECD/Eurostat databases. UN-Habitat also leads on collection of additional data on industrial wastewater generation and treatment.
