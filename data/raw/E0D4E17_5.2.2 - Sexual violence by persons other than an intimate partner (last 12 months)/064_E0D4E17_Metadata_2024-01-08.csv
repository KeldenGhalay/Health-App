Method of measurement,"Series of questions asked to women, currently or previously in a partnership, inquiring about experience of specific acts of physical and/or sexual violence by their partner. These questions are ideally asked by specially trained interviewers in household surveys dedicated to measurement of violence against women and protecting safety in accordance with WHO recommendations. Alternatively, other population-based surveys with modules on violence against women can be used. Implementation of surveys or survey modules on violence against women need to ensure the safety, privacy and confidentiality of the participant in accordance with WHO recommendations."
Method of estimation aggregates,"Global aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries that make up the world. Regional aggregates are weighted averages of all the countries within the region. Weights used are the population of women aged 15 to 49 from the most recent 2019 revision of the World Population Prospects. Where data are not available for all countries in any given region, regional aggregates may still be calculated. The number of countries included in the average is indicated.
It should be noted that regional and global figures should be interpreted with caution, as they do not necessarily represent with accuracy the region or world, especially for regions where population coverage is below 50 percent.
Custodian agencies, in consultation with the Member States, have produced-to-date global, regional, and country estimates, enhancing the quality and accuracy of 5.2.1 reporting and addressing the comparability challenges outlined above. These new regional and global estimates (2018) are included in this round and form a baseline for the monitoring of progress. These are also available for World Bank, Global Burden of Disease and individual agency regions."
Process of validation,"A country consultation on the intimate partner violence (IPV) estimates was conducted in early 2020. All countries received their country profile which included their data sources, estimate, and a technical note explaining the methodology (available in six official languages). The consultations ensured: i) countries had the opportunity to review their nationally modeled IPV estimate and the data sources (surveys/studies) used in the production of these estimates, ii) the identification of any additional surveys/studies that met the inclusion criteria (i.e published between 2000-2018, used acts-based measures of IPV, nationally or subnationally representative) but which may not have been previously identified; and iii) familiarize countries with the statistical modeling approach used to derive the global, regional, and national estimates."
Rationale,"Intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence that women face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other unions/relationships. Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and discrimination.
Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk and explore the barriers to seeking help to ensure that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies and developing effective responses and prevention programs. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and optimally target resources to maximize the effectiveness of interventions (especially in resource-constrained settings).
Aggregating individual women’s reported experiences of physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner estimates the level of exposure that women in intimate relationships are subjected to in a given country’s population, regionally and globally"
Denominator,"The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, or used different definitions of partner or spousal violence and recall periods (e.g., different definitions of “lifetime”). Many survey measures and/or reports lack disaggregation by different forms of intimate partner violence (physical, sexual, psychological). There are often differences in survey question formulations and/or denominators e.g. all women [various age ranges], or only ever-married/partnered or currently married/partnered women). There is also heterogeneity in age groups sampled and reported on. The quality of interviewer training also likely varies, although this is difficult to quantify. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to how the survey is implemented and the social/cultural context, and this can affect reported prevalence levels.
Given the wide variations in methodologies, measurement, and quality across studies from different countries, statistically adjusted estimates are currently needed to ensure comparability across countries and regions. However, generating estimates is an interim solution and individual countries need to collect robust, internationally comparable, high-quality data that reflect the relevant socio-economic, political and cultural risk, and protective factors associated with the prevalence of violence against women (VAW) to inform appropriate policy responses and programmatic decision-making. As more countries adopt international recommendations and guidelines, including the key elements described in this document, the need for adjustments for estimates for global monitoring will be greatly reduced.
Since 2000, only about 78 countries have conducted more than one survey on VAW. Obtaining data on VAW is a costly and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or modules in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the main source of data for low- and lower-middle Income Countries (LMICs), are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted usually with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available for regular surveys. At the same time prevalence is unlikely to change from year to year so, depending on resources, every 3-5 years is recommended.
This indicator calls for global reporting on three types of intimate partner violence (IPV): physical, sexual, and psychological. While there is global consensus on how physical and sexual IPV are generally defined and measured, psychological partner violence—is conceptualized differently across cultures and in different contexts. This indicator therefore currently reports on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to develop a global standard for measuring and reporting psychological IPV. This will enable reporting on the three stipulated types of partner violence in the future.
Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above have been subjected to. Most data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49, and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports on both violence ever-partnered women 15-49 years of age and 15 years and older have been subjected to. Given the existing limited data availability on violence against women aged 50 years and older, efforts are underway by the custodian agencies to improve the measurement and encourage increased availability of data for women of this age group. This will enable a better estimation of the extent of this problem and understanding the experiences of partner violence for women over 50."
Institutional mandate,"WHO is the directing and coordinating authority on international health within the United Nations System. It supports countries as they coordinate the efforts of multiple sectors of the government and partners to attain their health objectives and support their national health policies and strategies, including through developing norms and standards, and strengthening data collection, reporting, and use. The organization produces estimates and statistics for a wide range of diseases and health conditions including in its annual world health statistics report. It has led work on the measurement of violence against women since 1998, developed and tested new instruments for measuring VAW cross-culturally, as well as ethical and safety standards for research on VAW.
In 2016, WHO Member States endorsed the Global plan of action on strengthening the health system role in addressing violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children(WHA Resolution 69.5) Improving the collection and use of data was one of its four strategic directions and included: a) Developing and disseminating harmonized indicators and measurement tools to support Member States in collecting standardized information on VAWG; b) Supporting Member States to implement population-based surveys on VAW; c) Building capacity in the collection, analysis and use of data; d) Regularly updating estimates of the prevalence of VAW."

Comments,"Proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner by form of violence and by age in their lifetime are sub-targets of SDG 5.2.1."
Notes,"References to “violence against women” (VAW) throughout also include adolescent girls (15-19 years old).
The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: physical violence, sexual violence and psychological violence.
For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual, and psychological violence against women, see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014), and the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes ICCS (UNODC, 2015), and Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018. Global, regional, and national prevalence estimates for intimate partner violence against women and global and regional prevalence estimates for non-partner sexual violence against women (WHO, 2021)."
Data collection process,"Data are collated by the WHO on behalf of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Women.
Data come from publicly available survey data or data provided by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) or other relevant national entities through the consultation process with countries. For efficiency, some data are collated using existing data-compiling online platforms (e.g., DHS StatCompiler and the EU-wide Survey on Violence Against Women (Fundamental Rights Agency) Data Explorer))."
Preferred data sources,"The SDG 5.2.1 Indicator Database comprises data from population-based household surveys representative at the national and/or sub-national level and implementing a methodology that uses act-based questions. All sources date from 2000 to 2018.
A significant proportion of data from low- and middle-income countries are obtained from the Domestic Violence Module of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Some data come from dedicated surveys on violence against women in countries that have implemented, for example, WHO’s violence against women survey methodology or other methodologies consistent with international guidelines and best practices. In the case of higher-income countries, data were obtained from Crime Victimisation Surveys (CVS) or dedicated surveys."
Other data sources,Specific population surveys
Expected frequency of data collection,"Countries are encouraged to conduct surveys at regular intervals. The recommended interval, depending on available resources, is three (3) to five (5) years which will allow countries to effectively measure progress. The prevalence database will be updated on an annual basis."
Data providers,"Data are provided by nationally or sub-nationally representative surveys on violence against women conducted by National Statistical Offices (in most cases),line ministries/other national institutions or other entities."
Data compilers,"Data are compiled and reviewed by the Interagency Working Group on Violence against Women Data (WHO, UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD, UNFPA, UNODC)."
